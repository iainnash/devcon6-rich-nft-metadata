## Open Questions:

0. Should this be an EIP?
  Pro: Metadata is loosely defined by default
  Con: EIP focus is more for on-chain standards, off-chain is convention-based
1. Multiple files

## Goals

1. Have a canonical file of the NFT
   1. "the standard or primary authorative body of the subject"
2. Be able to show the canonical file across platforms as a link
   1. Specalized platforms can render directly

## Non-goals 

1. A way of expressing multiple file sizes / banners / color for rending
2. Something like oEmbed / opengraph for showing rendering
  1. It's not expected for generalized platforms to directly render the content key.
